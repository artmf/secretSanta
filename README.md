# secretSantaProject

Secret Santa has been a tradition in my family for many years. However, this year was the first Christmas that I had a little more experience with programming, and I decided to create a website that allows for some cool features. 

For the website to function, the user must be logged in, but at this point, there is no account creation functionality. The username and password were initially set by me. The user can add or remove participants at any time. After all the participants are inserted, there is a sorting button, which sorts the participants. After the sorting, a button appears that allows the user to send emails with the Secret Santa name for each participant. The email feature allows emails to be sent to a single participant or all of them at the same time. If the user adds or deletes a participant, the interface requires a new sorting action to be executed.

For this project, I used express, express-handlebars, client-sessions, Bootstrap, bcrypt, PostgreSQL, and nodemailer.

The idea now is to improve some features and add some more functionalities to the website. Some examples are better user interface, account creation feature, separate database for each user, and participant update feature. Also, I would like to constantly improve the code to make it more efficient and secure.
